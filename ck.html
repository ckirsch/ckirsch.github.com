Christoph Kirsch is Professor at the Department of Computer Sciences
of the University of Salzburg, Austria.
He received his Dr.Ing. degree from Saarland University, Saarbr&uuml;cken,
Germany, in 1999 while at the Max Planck Institute for Computer Science.
From 1999 to 2004 he worked as Postdoctoral Researcher at
the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences of the
University of California, Berkeley.
He later returned to Berkeley as Visiting Scholar (2008-2013) and
Visiting Professor (2014)
at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering as part of
a collaborative research effort in Cyber-Physical Systems.
His most recent research interests are in concurrent data structures,
memory management, and so-called spatial programming.
Dr. Kirsch co-invented embedded programming languages and systems
such as Giotto, HTL, and the Embedded Machine, and more recently co-designed
high-performance, multicore-scalable concurrent data structures and
memory management systems.
He co-founded the International Conference on Embedded Software (EMSOFT)
and served as ACM SIGBED chair from 2011 until 2013 and ACM TODAES
associate editor from 2011 until 2014.
He is currently associate editor of IEEE TCAD.
